## About Me

My name is Yu (Yuven) Duan (in Chinese: 段昱). I am a senior undergraduate student at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University, studying artificial intelligence. I am currently a member of **[MetaConscious Group](https://www.metaconscious.org/)** led by Prof. **[Guangyu Robert Yang](https://guangyuyang.org/)**, where I am working on multi-system models of working memory. Previously, at Tsinghua, I worked at **[ARChip Lab](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~maks/)** with Prof. Kaisheng Ma and Prof. Yi Zhong on brain-inspired neural networks and AI algorithms.

My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. By constructing system-level models of the brain (mainly neural networks for now), I plan to:
* Relate neural mechanisms (e.g., synaptic plasticity, neuromodulation) and brain structures (e.g., connectivity) to high-level cognitive processes;
* Investigate how optimization objectives or training procedures affect the network behavior and neural response;
* Give mechanistic illustrations of how complex cognitive processes (e.g., memory, consciousness, emotions) take place.
  
Apart from modeling, I am also interested in working with real neural data and extracting useful knowledge from these data with mathematical or machine-learning approaches. In the long term, I aim to build more human-like AI with our knowledge of neuroscience and cognitive science.
