## About Me

My name is Yu Duan (in Chinese: 段昱). Starting in 2023 fall, I will be studying at MIT EECS as a Ph.D. student. As an undergrad, I studied computer science at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University. I am currently a member of **[MetaConscious Group](https://www.metaconscious.org/)** led by Prof. **[Guangyu Robert Yang](https://guangyuyang.org/)**, where I am working on multi-system models of working memory. At Tsinghua, I worked with Prof. Kaisheng Ma and Prof. Yi Zhong on networks with synaptic plasticity and models of the fruit fly mushroom body. I also worked with Prof. Pei Sun on vision encoders with human-aligned representations. My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. By constructing system-level models of the brain (mainly neural networks for now), I plan to: 

* Relate neural mechanisms (e.g., synaptic plasticity, neuromodulation) and brain structures (e.g., connectivity) to high-level cognitive processes; 
* Investigate how optimization objectives or training procedures affect the network behavior and neural response; 
* Give mechanistic illustrations of how complex cognitive processes (e.g., memory, consciousness, emotions) take place. 
  
Apart from modeling, I am also interested in working with real neural data and extracting useful knowledge from these data with mathematical or machine-learning approaches. In the long term, I aim to build human-aligned intelligence with our knowledge of neuroscience and cognitive science.
